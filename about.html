<div id="about_me_main"> 
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body">Hey there! Welcome to the "About Me" page, where I drop some of the professionalism from the home page so you can get a look at the woman who made the site you're viewing.</p>
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body2">As mentioned previously, you can call me Wintry (a name granted to me by my first group of online friends). Iâ€™m interested in video games, writing, coding, Dungeons & Dragons, along with basically anything else you could consider nerdy. I also have a major love of retro designs, particularly those riffing on the 80s, as evidenced by most of this website. As a young writer, I hope this website can serve as a place for me to host my work and be able to make a space for myself.</p>
        <p class="AN" id="about_me_body2">Like I said on the Home page, this website is a major work in progress. Since I code everything by hand, it takes a lot of time, research, and effort to get things working. Please stay patient as I add more features, and let me know if you have any suggestions by sending me a quick DM on Discord.</p>
